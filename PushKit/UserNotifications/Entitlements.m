     This key specifics whether to use the development or
     production Apple Push Notification service(APNs)
     environment when registering for push notifications.
     
     Xcode sets the value of the entitlement based on your
     app's current provisioning profile. For example, if
     you're using a development provisioning profile, Xcode
     sets the value to development. Production provisioning
     profile and Prerelease Versions and Beta Testers use
     production. These default settings can be modified.
     The development environment is also referred to as the
     sandbox environment.
     
     Use this entitlement for both the UserNotifications and
     PushKit frameworks.
     
     To add this entitlement to your app, enable the Push
     Notifications capability in Xcode.
